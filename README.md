## Reddit moderation is broken
My experience is that reddit's own moderation is incapable of basic literacy. As suck it cannot be trusted and has a monopoly position. Of course, they also have monopolistics attention so we must coexist.

What will happen is that they make incorrect arbitrary decisions and they say no soapboxing in the report forums.
