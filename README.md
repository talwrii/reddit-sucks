## Reddit is a despotic dictator
Reddit has a defacto dictatorship over much of the internet and has borken moderation. Dictators rules don't matter, we can play dirty.




## Reddit moderation is broken
My experience is that reddit's own moderation is incapable of basic literacy. As suck it cannot be trusted and has a monopoly position. Of course, they also have monopolistics attention so we must coexist.

What will happen is that they make incorrect arbitrary decisions and they say no soapboxing in the report forums. 


## How to evade reddit
As reddit cannot be trusted to enforce its own rules - you must evade them. Some approaches: build audiences away from reddit, where possible try to move containers to someone you control.

You can *separate* your use of reddit to provide protection from their policies. I.e. have a different identity for different subreddits.



## How to hold reddit to account

No soapboxing: Make them eat soap - submit your reddit gripes here and I will publish them:
